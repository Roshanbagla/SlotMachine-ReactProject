Created another project as part of ReactJS learning.

Created a simple Slot Machine using React components. The reason of creating the miniprojet was to gain indepth knowledge of ReactJS and how to make use of if else statements 
along with CSS.

This time I deployed my project on Google Cloud: http://summer-surfer-281509.df.r.appspot.com/
